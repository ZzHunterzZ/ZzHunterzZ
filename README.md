👋 Hi, I'm Sebastião Dos Santos, also known as Hibrido.

🌍 I'm from Angola and I'm a student of Electronics and Telecommunications.

🎓 Currently, I'm focusing on learning React JS Full and then React Native.

🏀 Besides my studies, I have an interest in and practice sports like football, basketball, capoeira, and Brazilian Jiujitsu. In entertainment, I enjoy watching anime, movies, playing video games, and following series. I also have a passion for software development and electronic circuits.

🚀 I'm always seeking new knowledge and experiences, and I'm open to collaborating on projects and ideas that drive Angola or the whole of Africa forward.
